# MemeMe2.0

## Description
* "MemeMe 2.0" is one of Udacity's Swift Nanodegree Projects.
* Contains "MemeMe" app functions and layout.
* The user is able to create memes by selecting an image (from the camera or photo library) and write top and bottom texts for it.
* After creating the meme image, it is displayed in both a collection and a table view and the image can be shared.
* **Note**: App implementation is outdated and does not reflect my current programming skills.

## Objectives
* "MemeMe 2.0" was created as a final exercise for the UIKit basics lessons of the Nanodegree.
* This repository only serves as a reference to the old code, for. An updated and refactored version can be found [here](https://github.com/andrebocato/MemeMe.git).
